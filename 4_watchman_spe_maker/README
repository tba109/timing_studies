plot_raw: plot the raw data (good for tuning cuts, waveforms)
plot_fft: plot the FFT of the raw data
l1:       Implement l1 cuts for selecting SPEs in a few steps: 
	  1.) Create sinc LPF kernel with 4000 points and a 250MHz cutoff, centered and zero 
	      padded, Blackman windowed
	  2.) Baseline subtract raw data
	  3.) Convolve with filter kernel
	  4.) Use discriminator on window around the pulse, threshold is -0.25mV (~1/20 SPE)
	  5.) Write these to file as l1. 
	  6.) Make time plots to select SPEs in charge range -2.5E6 to -1.1E7. Find timing 
	      resolution (main peak ~0.7ns).   
a1:       Find the charge, amplitude, and time characteristics and figure out an average waveform
	  shape. 
a2:       Try to ignore double pulse by cutting out those that pass a -2mV threshold after 75ns
l3:       Shift all of the waveforms so that their 50% crossing lines up. This gives a nice, aligned
	  set of SPEs.
