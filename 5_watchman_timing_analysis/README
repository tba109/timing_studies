Find average waveform and fit it. 
c*((exp(-(x-x0)/b1)+exp((x-x0)/b2))^p)

a1.py:  mainly find CFD, amplitude, charge. Average waveform. Question: is trapezoidal integration better than rectangular integration, or vice versa? 
        most probable amplitude = -6.5mV
l3b.py: turn these into binary values, to simulate a 14b ADC. Also, allow the addition of noise (std ~ 2.5b to simulate digitizer), also baseline, etc.
