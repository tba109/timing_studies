plot_raw: plot the raw data (good for tuning cuts, waveforms)
plot_fft: plot the FFT of the raw data
l1:       Implement l1 cuts for selecting SPEs in a few steps: 
	  1.) Create sinc LPF kernel with 4000 points and a 250MHz cutoff, centered and zero 
	      padded, Blackman windowed
	  2.) Baseline subtract raw data
	  3.) Convolve with filter kernel
	  4.) Use discriminator on window around the pulse, threshold is -0.25mV (~1/20 SPE)
	  5.) Write these to file as l1. 
	  6.) Make time plots to select SPEs in charge range -2.5E6 to -1.1E7. Find timing 
	      resolution (main peak ~0.7ns).
