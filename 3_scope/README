tz_scope:       analyze PMT data for zero crossing at fixed tau, FGSPS, NAVG1, CFDD, CFDTHR, etc...
tau_scope:      plot PMT data over a range of tau (first order filter)
navg1_scope:    plot PMT data over a range of box car average windows
bessel_scope:   plot PMT data simulating a bessel antialiasing low pass filter
bessel_compare: compare frequency response of bessel functions (bessel for linear phase)
